# Shiny-seq

## A dashboard to query gene expression in the Drop-seq dataset.

This repository contains the source for Shiny-seq. It is a Shiny based dashboard used to query the R objects calculated using the R code in mu Drop-seq repository. Due to the resources needed to run the app (>60Gb RAM), the full app is not hosted outside the lab local network.
   
A scaled-down, simplyfied version of the app can be found at [https://wtoddfarmer.shinyapps.io/Shiny-seq/](https://wtoddfarmer.shinyapps.io/Shiny-seq/). A presentation about the app can be found at [https://wtoddfarmer.github.io/shiny-seq-lite/shiny-seq_pres.html](https://wtoddfarmer.github.io/shiny-seq-lite/shiny-seq_pres.html).
